Online platform for generating customizable web pages: We Are

## DESCRIPTION AND JUSTIFICATION OF THE TOPIC TO BE TREATED
Since the arrival of platforms such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Twitter among others that allow users to have a presence on the internet and create their own space in which to share photos, comments or experiences. However, most of these sites are highly geared towards a mass audience, where likes and ratings are the way to measure progress.

In the absence of specific sites, some users turn to these platforms to manage small groups of people gathered around a hobby or a common meeting point, although it is not their main use. This means that they cannot always communicate in the way they would like or configure the experience in the way that is most useful to them. Such as groups of friends, leisure clubs such as sports or reading among many others, or pages such as databases of video games, series or movies.

To solve this problem, this project proposes to generate a platform with which users can create their own web page without having programming knowledge. The platform will offer a series of components that can be added to the web. The resulting website will be highly customizable and modified, being able to add information and new sections, modify them, delete them, manage privacy.

## PROJECT OBJECTIVES
The project has the following objectives:
1.	Analyze existing solutions and perform surveys to find out the needs of users who want to create a web page.
2.	Development of a web platform for the generation of websites without the need for programming
    -	The web platform will have a catalog of components that can be added to the web.
    -	The web platform will be able to automatically display the created web.
3.	The resulting website will be highly customizable and with a simple and understandable interface for the user.
